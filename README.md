**Project Title:** Enhancing Healthcare Analysis with Data Insights

**Problem Statements:** In healthcare, effective decision-making plays an important role in improving patient outcomes and optimizing hospital operations. The task is to analyze these datasets, uncovering trends and insights that could improve patient outcomes and optimize hospital operations. Without a clear understanding of the trends within this data, healthcare providers struggle to make informed decisions, hindering both patient care and operational efficiency.

**Objectives:** The primary objective is to utilize the power of Power BI for a comprehensive exploration of the healthcare datasets. This involves detailed data cleaning and advanced data modeling using DAX to facilitate advanced analytics. The ultimate goal is to craft an interactive dashboard in Power BI that communicates a coherent story derived from the healthcare data. This dashboard aims to highlight crucial trends, such as the relationship between patient demographics and treatment outcomes, the financial implications of different medical procedures, and overall hospital performance metrics. The analysis seeks to provide actionable insights, empowering healthcare providers to enhance patient care and streamline operational processes. By achieving these objectives, HealthStat Solutions aims to establish itself as a leader in the field of healthcare analytics.

**Data source:** Dataset contains two files 'Patient Medical Records' and 'Hospital Treatment Details'. The 'Patient Medical Records' dataset contains detailed information on patients, including their age, gender, blood type, diagnosis, treatments, admission and discharge dates, and total bills. The 'Hospital Treatment Details' dataset provides insights into the hospitals treating these patients, including the treating doctor, room number, daily costs, treatment types, and recovery ratings.

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Imported and used transform tab there were some null values and needed to change datatype. used inner merge and PatientID is a common column i.e. foreign key. Data quality was good, had only missing values in some column and filled with appropriate values. Converted date column to appropriate format and created new column as 'length of stay'('AdmissionDate' - 'DischargeDate').Created the AgeGroup column using add column using conditions from add column tab and adult has more values.

**Insights:** After conducting a detailed analysis of the healthcare dataset, several key insights have emerged. The data reveals that the majority of patients fall into the adult age group, with seniors and children following closely behind. Notably, therapy treatments consistently demonstrate higher recovery rates, indicating their effectiveness in patient recovery. Furthermore, the analysis highlights the efficient management of a high patient load at Silver Oak Medical Plaza, coupled with competitive recovery ratings, showcasing the hospital's operational prowess.
A moderate correlation between the length of patient stays and the total treatment cost is observed, emphasizing the financial implications associated with prolonged hospitalization. Gender-specific patterns in diagnoses have been identified, providing valuable information to target interventions more effectively. Additionally, the prevalence of Blood Type B- stands out, holding significance for blood banks and treatment planning.
Examining seasonal patterns in-patient admissions suggests a linear trend, allowing healthcare providers to anticipate and prepare for fluctuations in demand throughout the year. Surprisingly, there is no clear correlation between a higher patient load and lower recovery ratings among doctors, indicating that the volume of patients does not necessarily compromise the quality of care provided.
Lastly, predictive analytics point towards an anticipated increase in hospital capacity needs, with variations expected across different hospitals. These insights collectively contribute to a more informed approach to healthcare management, enabling proactive interventions, resource optimization, and improved patient outcomes.

**Conclusion:** The interactive dashboard created in Power BI serves as a powerful tool for ongoing analysis and decision support. It provides stakeholders with a user-friendly interface to explore the data, visualize trends, and gain actionable insights. By continuing to refine and update the dashboard with new data and insights, HealthStat Solutions can remain at the forefront of healthcare analytics, driving innovation and improvement in the industry.
